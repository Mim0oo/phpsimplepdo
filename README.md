phpsimplepdo
============

This is a PHP simple script to create a login page in PHP/MySQL using PDO Query statements

Using this script you will be able to:
* Create a login page to DB with members (password need to be stored as MD5 in the DB)
* Start user session for logged users for acccessing specific web interfaces
* Protect by PDO and string escaped to deny any try of malicious MySQL injection attempts
* Writing audit data for successful and unsuccessful login attempts and their ip address for additional monitoring

Repository is curently under development in order to be optimised so that it can be easily applicable
Any additional help in this will be apreciated
This code is used in my web login systems but here it will be changed for universal needs
